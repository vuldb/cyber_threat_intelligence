# ResolverRAT - Cyber Threat Intelligence

These _indicators_ were reported, collected, and generated during the [VulDB CTI analysis](https://vuldb.com/?kb.cti) of the actor known as [ResolverRAT](https://vuldb.com/?actor.resolverrat). The _activity monitoring_ correlates data from social media, forums, chat rooms, and darknet markets. It helps to determine associated actors, specific activities, expected intentions, emerging research, and ongoing attacks. Our unique _predictive model_ uses _big data_ to forecast activities and their characteristics.

_Live data_ and more _analysis capabilities_ are available at [https://vuldb.com/?actor.resolverrat](https://vuldb.com/?actor.resolverrat)

4 | T1059 | CWE-94 | Argument Injection | High
5 | T1059.007 | CWE-79, CWE-80 | Basic Cross Site Scripting | High
6 | ... | ... | ... | ...

There are 22 more TTP items available. Please use our online service to access the data.
