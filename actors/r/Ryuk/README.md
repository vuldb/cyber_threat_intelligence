# Ryuk - Cyber Threat Intelligence

These _indicators_ were reported, collected, and generated during the [VulDB CTI analysis](https://vuldb.com/?kb.cti) of the actor known as [Ryuk](https://vuldb.com/?actor.ryuk). The _activity monitoring_ correlates data from social media, forums, chat rooms, and darknet markets. It helps to determine associated actors, specific activities, expected intentions, emerging research, and ongoing attacks. Our unique _predictive model_ uses _big data_ to forecast activities and their characteristics.

_Live data_ and more _analysis capabilities_ are available at [https://vuldb.com/?actor.ryuk](https://vuldb.com/?actor.ryuk)

## Countries

These _countries_ are directly (e.g. origin of attacks) or indirectly (e.g. access by proxy) associated with Ryuk:

* [CN](https://vuldb.com/?country.cn)
* [US](https://vuldb.com/?country.us)
* [CH](https://vuldb.com/?country.ch)
