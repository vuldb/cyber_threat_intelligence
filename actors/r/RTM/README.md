# RTM - Cyber Threat Intelligence

These _indicators_ were reported, collected, and generated during the [VulDB CTI analysis](https://vuldb.com/?kb.cti) of the actor known as [RTM](https://vuldb.com/?actor.rtm). The _activity monitoring_ correlates data from social media, forums, chat rooms, and darknet markets. It helps to determine associated actors, specific activities, expected intentions, emerging research, and ongoing attacks. Our unique _predictive model_ uses _big data_ to forecast activities and their characteristics.

_Live data_ and more _analysis capabilities_ are available at [https://vuldb.com/?actor.rtm](https://vuldb.com/?actor.rtm)

## Campaigns

The following _campaigns_ are known and can be associated with RTM:

* Buhtrap/Buran

## Countries

These _countries_ are directly (e.g. origin of attacks) or indirectly (e.g. access by proxy) associated with RTM:

* [NL](https://vuldb.com/?country.nl)
* [US](https://vuldb.com/?country.us)
* [IR](https://vuldb.com/?country.ir)
* ...

There are 11 more country items available. Please use our online service to access the data.

## IOC - Indicator of Compromise

These _indicators of compromise_ (IOC) indicate associated network resources which are known to be part of research and attack activities of RTM.
