# IRCflu and Interplanetary Storm - Cyber Threat Intelligence

These _indicators_ were reported, collected, and generated during the [VulDB CTI analysis](https://vuldb.com/?kb.cti) of the actor known as [IRCflu and Interplanetary Storm](https://vuldb.com/?actor.ircflu_and_interplanetary_storm). The _activity monitoring_ correlates data from social media, forums, chat rooms, and darknet markets. It helps to determine associated actors, specific activities, expected intentions, emerging research, and ongoing attacks. Our unique _predictive model_ uses _big data_ to forecast activities and their characteristics.

_Live data_ and more _analysis capabilities_ are available at [https://vuldb.com/?actor.ircflu_and_interplanetary_storm](https://vuldb.com/?actor.ircflu_and_interplanetary_storm)
