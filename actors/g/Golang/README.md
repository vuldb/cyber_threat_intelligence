# Golang - Cyber Threat Intelligence

These _indicators_ were reported, collected, and generated during the [VulDB CTI analysis](https://vuldb.com/?kb.cti) of the actor known as [Golang](https://vuldb.com/?actor.golang). The _activity monitoring_ correlates data from social media, forums, chat rooms, and darknet markets. It helps to determine associated actors, specific activities, expected intentions, emerging research, and ongoing attacks. Our unique _predictive model_ uses _big data_ to forecast activities and their characteristics.

_Live data_ and more _analysis capabilities_ are available at [https://vuldb.com/?actor.golang](https://vuldb.com/?actor.golang)

## Campaigns

The following _campaigns_ are known and can be associated with Golang:

* CVE-2022-26134

## Countries

These _countries_ are directly (e.g. origin of attacks) or indirectly (e.g. access by proxy) associated with Golang:

* [GB](https://vuldb.com/?country.gb)
* [RU](https://vuldb.com/?country.ru)
* [US](https://vuldb.com/?country.us)
* ...

There are 6 more country items available. Please use our online service to access the data.
