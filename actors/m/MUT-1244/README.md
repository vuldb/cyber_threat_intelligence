# MUT-1244 - Cyber Threat Intelligence

These _indicators_ were reported, collected, and generated during the [VulDB CTI analysis](https://vuldb.com/?kb.cti) of the actor known as [MUT-1244](https://vuldb.com/?actor.mut-1244). The _activity monitoring_ correlates data from social media, forums, chat rooms, and darknet markets. It helps to determine associated actors, specific activities, expected intentions, emerging research, and ongoing attacks. Our unique _predictive model_ uses _big data_ to forecast activities and their characteristics.

_Live data_ and more _analysis capabilities_ are available at [https://vuldb.com/?actor.mut-1244](https://vuldb.com/?actor.mut-1244)

4 | ... | ... | ... | ...

There are 7 more TTP items available. Please use our online service to access the data.

## IOA - Indicator of Attack

These _indicators of attack_ (IOA) list the potential fragments used for technical activities like reconnaissance, exploitation, privilege escalation, and exfiltration by MUT-1244. This data is unique as it uses our predictive model for actor profiling.

ID | Type | Indicator | Confidence
-- | ---- | --------- | ----------
1 | File | `/uncpath/` | Medium
2 | File | `/_vti_pvt/access.cnf` | High
3 | File | `agent/Core/SpawningKit/Spawner.h` | High
4 | ... | ... | ...

There are 24 more IOA items available (file, library, argument, input value, pattern, network port). Please use our online service to access the data.
