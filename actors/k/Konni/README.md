# Konni - Cyber Threat Intelligence

These _indicators_ were reported, collected, and generated during the [VulDB CTI analysis](https://vuldb.com/?kb.cti) of the actor known as [Konni](https://vuldb.com/?actor.konni). The _activity monitoring_ correlates data from social media, forums, chat rooms, and darknet markets. It helps to determine associated actors, specific activities, expected intentions, emerging research, and ongoing attacks. Our unique _predictive model_ uses _big data_ to forecast activities and their characteristics.

_Live data_ and more _analysis capabilities_ are available at [https://vuldb.com/?actor.konni](https://vuldb.com/?actor.konni)

## Countries

These _countries_ are directly (e.g. origin of attacks) or indirectly (e.g. access by proxy) associated with Konni:

* [US](https://vuldb.com/?country.us)
* [CN](https://vuldb.com/?country.cn)
* [GB](https://vuldb.com/?country.gb)

1 | T1006 | CWE-21, CWE-22 | Path Traversal | High
2 | T1055 | CWE-74 | Improper Neutralization of Data within XPath Expressions | High
3 | T1059 | CWE-94 | Argument Injection | High
4 | ... | ... | ... | ...

There are 11 more TTP items available. Please use our online service to access the data.

## IOA - Indicator of Attack

These _indicators of attack_ (IOA) list the potential fragments used for technical activities like reconnaissance, exploitation, privilege escalation, and exfiltration by Konni. This data is unique as it uses our predictive model for actor profiling.

ID | Type | Indicator | Confidence
-- | ---- | --------- | ----------
1 | File | `/admin/admin_manage/delete` | High
2 | File | `/cgi-bin/activate.cgi` | High
3 | File | `/cgi-bin/system_mgr.cgi` | High
4 | File | `/config/getuser` | High
5 | File | `/freelance/resume_list` | High
6 | File | `/HNAP1` | Low
7 | File | `/my_photo_gallery/image.php` | High
8 | File | `/reps/classes/Users.php?f=delete_agent` | High
9 | File | `/s/` | Low
10 | ... | ... | ...

There are 77 more IOA items available (file, library, argument, input value, pattern, network port). Please use our online service to access the data.
