# Hexmen - Cyber Threat Intelligence

These _indicators_ were reported, collected, and generated during the [VulDB CTI analysis](https://vuldb.com/?kb.cti) of the actor known as [Hexmen](https://vuldb.com/?actor.hexmen). The _activity monitoring_ correlates data from social media, forums, chat rooms, and darknet markets. It helps to determine associated actors, specific activities, expected intentions, emerging research, and ongoing attacks. Our unique _predictive model_ uses _big data_ to forecast activities and their characteristics.

_Live data_ and more _analysis capabilities_ are available at [https://vuldb.com/?actor.hexmen](https://vuldb.com/?actor.hexmen)

## Countries

These _countries_ are directly (e.g. origin of attacks) or indirectly (e.g. access by proxy) associated with Hexmen:

* [US](https://vuldb.com/?country.us)
* [CN](https://vuldb.com/?country.cn)

## IOC - Indicator of Compromise

These _indicators of compromise_ (IOC) indicate associated network resources which are known to be part of research and attack activities of Hexmen.

1 | T1059.007 | CWE-79 | Cross Site Scripting | High
2 | T1202 | CWE-77 | Command Shell in Externally Accessible Directory | High
3 | T1505 | CWE-89 | SQL Injection | High

## IOA - Indicator of Attack

These _indicators of attack_ (IOA) list the potential fragments used for technical activities like reconnaissance, exploitation, privilege escalation, and exfiltration by Hexmen. This data is unique as it uses our predictive model for actor profiling.

ID | Type | Indicator | Confidence
-- | ---- | --------- | ----------
1 | File | `/ecommerce/admin/settings/setDiscount.php` | High
2 | File | `/wireless/guestnetwork.asp` | High
3 | File | `/wireless/security.asp` | High
4 | ... | ... | ...

There are 19 more IOA items available (file, library, argument, input value, pattern, network port). Please use our online service to access the data.
