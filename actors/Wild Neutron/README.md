# Wild Neutron - Cyber Threat Intelligence

These _indicators_ were reported, collected, and generated during the [VulDB CTI analysis](https://vuldb.com/?kb.cti) of the actor known as [Wild Neutron](https://vuldb.com/?actor.wild_neutron). The _activity monitoring_ correlates data from social media, forums, chat rooms, and darknet markets. It helps to determine associated actors, specific activities, expected intentions, emerging research, and ongoing attacks. Our unique _predictive model_ uses _big data_ to forecast activities and their characteristics.

_Live data_ and more _analysis capabilities_ are available at [https://vuldb.com/?actor.wild_neutron](https://vuldb.com/?actor.wild_neutron)

1 | T1006 | CWE-21, CWE-22, CWE-23 | Pathname Traversal | High
2 | T1040 | CWE-294 | Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay | High
3 | T1055 | CWE-74 | Injection | High
4 | T1059 | CWE-94 | Cross Site Scripting | High
5 | ... | ... | ... | ...

There are 17 more TTP items available. Please use our online service to access the data.

## IOA - Indicator of Attack

These _indicators of attack_ (IOA) list the potential fragments used for technical activities like reconnaissance, exploitation, privilege escalation, and exfiltration by Wild Neutron. This data is unique as it uses our predictive model for actor profiling.
