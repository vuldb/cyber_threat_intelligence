# Italy/Kazakhstan - Cyber Threat Intelligence

These _indicators_ were reported, collected, and generated during the [VulDB CTI analysis](https://vuldb.com/?kb.cti) of the campaign known as _Italy/Kazakhstan_. The _activity monitoring_ correlates data from social media, forums, chat rooms, and darknet markets. It helps to determine associated actors, specific activities, expected intentions, emerging research, and ongoing attacks. Our unique _predictive model_ uses _big data_ to forecast activities and their characteristics.

_Live data_ and more _analysis capabilities_ are available at [https://vuldb.com/?actor](https://vuldb.com/?actor)

## Countries

These _countries_ are directly (e.g. origin of attacks) or indirectly (e.g. access by proxy) associated with Italy/Kazakhstan:

* [IT](https://vuldb.com/?country.it)
* [CN](https://vuldb.com/?country.cn)

## Actors

These _actors_ are associated with Italy/Kazakhstan or other actors linked to the campaign.

ID | Actor | Confidence
-- | ----- | ----------
1 | [Unknown](https://vuldb.com/?actor.unknown) | High

## IOC - Indicator of Compromise

These _indicators of compromise_ (IOC) indicate associated network resources which are known to be part of research and attack activities of Italy/Kazakhstan.

ID | IP address | Hostname | Actor | Confidence
-- | ---------- | -------- | ----- | ----------
1 | [2.228.150.86](https://vuldb.com/?ip.2.228.150.86) | 2-228-150-86.ip192.fastwebnet.it | [Unknown](https://vuldb.com/?actor.unknown) | High

## TTP - Tactics, Techniques, Procedures

_Tactics, techniques, and procedures_ (TTP) summarize the suspected MITRE ATT&CK techniques used within Italy/Kazakhstan. This data is unique as it uses our predictive model for actor profiling.

ID | Technique | Weakness | Description | Confidence
-- | --------- | -------- | ----------- | ----------
1 | T1059.007 | CWE-80 | Cross Site Scripting | High
2 | T1592 | CWE-200 | Invocation of Process Using Visible Sensitive Information | High

## IOA - Indicator of Attack

These _indicators of attack_ (IOA) list the potential fragments used for technical activities like reconnaissance, exploitation, privilege escalation, and exfiltration during Italy/Kazakhstan. This data is unique as it uses our predictive model for actor profiling.

ID | Type | Indicator | Confidence
-- | ---- | --------- | ----------
1 | File | `/admin/template.php` | High
2 | File | `ngx_resolver.c` | High
3 | File | `pearcmd.php` | Medium
4 | ... | ... | ...

There are 3 more IOA items available (file, library, argument, input value, pattern, network port). Please use our online service to access the data.
