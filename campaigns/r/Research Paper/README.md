# Research Paper - Cyber Threat Intelligence

These _indicators_ were reported, collected, and generated during the [VulDB CTI analysis](https://vuldb.com/?kb.cti) of the campaign known as _Research Paper_. The _activity monitoring_ correlates data from social media, forums, chat rooms, and darknet markets. It helps to determine associated actors, specific activities, expected intentions, emerging research, and ongoing attacks. Our unique _predictive model_ uses _big data_ to forecast activities and their characteristics.

_Live data_ and more _analysis capabilities_ are available at [https://vuldb.com/?actor](https://vuldb.com/?actor)

## Countries

These _countries_ are directly (e.g. origin of attacks) or indirectly (e.g. access by proxy) associated with Research Paper:

* [VN](https://vuldb.com/?country.vn)

## Actors

These _actors_ are associated with Research Paper or other actors linked to the campaign.

ID | Actor | Confidence
-- | ----- | ----------
1 | [Kimsuky](https://vuldb.com/?actor.kimsuky) | High

## IOC - Indicator of Compromise

These _indicators of compromise_ (IOC) indicate associated network resources which are known to be part of research and attack activities of Research Paper.

ID | IP address | Hostname | Actor | Confidence
-- | ---------- | -------- | ----- | ----------
1 | [103.130.212.116](https://vuldb.com/?ip.103.130.212.116) | - | [Kimsuky](https://vuldb.com/?actor.kimsuky) | High
2 | [103.149.98.230](https://vuldb.com/?ip.103.149.98.230) | - | [Kimsuky](https://vuldb.com/?actor.kimsuky) | High

## TTP - Tactics, Techniques, Procedures

_Tactics, techniques, and procedures_ (TTP) summarize the suspected MITRE ATT&CK techniques used within Research Paper. This data is unique as it uses our predictive model for actor profiling.

ID | Technique | Weakness | Description | Confidence
-- | --------- | -------- | ----------- | ----------
1 | T1068 | CWE-264 | Execution with Unnecessary Privileges | High
