# CVE-2022-29303 and CVE-2022-40881 and CVE-2023-23333 and CVE-2023-29 - Cyber Threat Intelligence

These _indicators_ were reported, collected, and generated during the [VulDB CTI analysis](https://vuldb.com/?kb.cti) of the campaign known as _CVE-2022-29303 and CVE-2022-40881 and CVE-2023-23333 and CVE-2023-29_. The _activity monitoring_ correlates data from social media, forums, chat rooms, and darknet markets. It helps to determine associated actors, specific activities, expected intentions, emerging research, and ongoing attacks. Our unique _predictive model_ uses _big data_ to forecast activities and their characteristics.
